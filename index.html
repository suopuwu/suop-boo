                        <p>
                            For nearly as long as I can remember, I've played Smash Bros. It was in middle school that I
                            got
                            serious about it and started entering tournaments. Throughout my time competing, I would
                            study
                            gameplay to try and improve as much as possible. This helped, but I always felt like I would
                            forget
                            the lessons I learned. That's why I made Big Brain Notes in high school. Though a normal
                            note
                            taking
                            app might work, they often didn't support images, and they were not organized for my
                            specific
                            use
                            case.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started by opening a notebook and writing down all the things that I would want a notes
                            app to
                            do.
                            After that, I drew mockups of the various screens and how they would flow together.
                            Throughout
                            the
                            process, I was laser focused on creating a good experience: quite literally an app I would
                            want
                            to
                            use. I had to learn Flutter from scratch. It was a difficult process, as this was the first
                            big
                            project that I had ever undertaken. Despite that, the hundreds of hours spent learning and
                            programming were worth it. I finished the app, and used it to become ranked number one in
                            the
                            state,
                            and the app got rave reviews online.

                            There are two versions: a mobile and a web version. The web version is incomplete, but it
                            still
                            served as a valuable project to learn how to use firebase. The mobile version currently has
                            a
                            4.9
                            star rating on the Google Play store. Here are some reviews:

                            A professor at my university had a personal website in Wordpress that he wanted to give a
                            makeover.
                            Over the course of a few months, we did a lot of work on the website through a few in person
                            meetings and around 300 emails. I started by making mockups in Figma until he found one that
                            he
                            liked. With that done, I developed the theme and plugins necessary for the functionality he
                            wanted.
                            After that, we went through smaller tweaks to the website, until he was satisfied.
                            Throughout
                            the
                            process, I made sure to communicate clearly and to his satisfaction, and it seems to have
                            worked. In
                            one of our last communications, he said "Iâ€™m really happy with the website, thanks for all
                            your
                            work
                            and answering and fixing my many questions."

                            This was a project I made for my father, the owner of Memorable Giving. Memorable Giving is
                            a
                            company that makes nursery signs for new parents. It got its start on Etsy, like many
                            handmade
                            goods
                            companies. Unfortunately, Etsy's policies gradually grew more and more hostile to its
                            sellers
                            over
                            time. As such, My father had me make an ecommerce website to replace his Etsy shop. Written
                            using
                            Asp.net with Razor Pages and EF Core, it's a simple storefront that uses stripe to process
                            payments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hadn't ever undertaken a project in C# before, but I dove into development. I gained
                            valuable
                            experience using all the technologies involved, from Azure services to Postgres. My father
                            didn't
                            want to edit the code himself, so I made an admin page with ui for adding products.

                        <p>These are two frontend libraries that I am quite happy with. One allows you to create android
                            style
                            snackbars, and the other lets you create popups / lightboxes. Designed to be as simple to
                            use as
                            possible, you just have to put the script on your website. Over the course of making these,
                            I
                            spent
                            hours tinkering with minor ui changes. The end result is that they feel smooth to use. Here,
                            try
                            it

                            I've always loved video games, so I wanted to make my own. That said, I was not in a very

                            mood when I made this, so it uses sprites from Eversion, one of my favorite 2d platformers.
